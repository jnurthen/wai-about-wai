## Introduction

We hope you'll find accessibility work on this page that you are interested in contributing to through the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). After each item, is the acronym of the responsible Working Group (WG) and some Task Forces (TF), so you know where to go if you want to participate. That information is later in this page &mdash; first, let's look at some of the work itself.

## Current Work Highlights

### Updating Core Guidelines and Other Standards

* **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2** is addressing comments on the previous draft and plans  to be completed in 2022. Note that these links have information that will change: [What's New in WCAG 2.2 Working Draft](/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/), [WCAG 2.2 Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/)  _[AG WG]_

* **W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0** an early draft of a few aspects of a potential new standard. It is years away from being finalized. [[WCAG 3 Introduction]](/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/) _[AG WG]_

* **ARIA** is finalizing implementations of [ARIA 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/) as well as adding new [features to ARIA 1.3](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#substantive-changes-targeted-for-the-1-3-release).  _[ARIA WG]_


### Developing New Standards

* **Personalization** (renaming in progress, maybe _Personalized Adaptation_) involves tailoring the user experience to meet the needs and preferences of the individual user. [[Personalization Overview]](/personalization/) _[APA WG, Personalization TF]_

* **Spoken Pronunciation** technical standards are being developed to enable screen readers and voice assistants to pronounce words correctly. [[Pronunciation Overview]](/pronunciation/) _[APA WG, Spoken Pronunciation TF]_

### Documenting Additional Guidance for People with Cognitive Disabilities, Low Vision, and Mobile Devices

* **Cognitive Accessibility** &mdash; We are updating several documents to better address the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities. [[Cognitive Accessibility at W3C]](/cognitive/). _[AG WG, COGA TF]_

* **EPUB Fixed Layout Accessibility** &mdash; aims to help publishers produce more accessible content and address challenges for people with cognitive disabilities and low vision. [EPUB Fixed Layout Accessibility Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/fxl-a11y/) _[EPUB3 WG, FXL A11y TF]_

* **Low Vision Accessibility**  &mdash; We are writing guidance that goes beyong the minimums required by WCAG. It is called "supplemental guidance". Current topics cover proximity, printing, and alternative themes such as high contrast and dark mode. _[AG WG, Low Vision TF]_

* **Mobile Accessibility** &mdash; work includes supporting on-going standards development, including supporting WCAG 3. [[Mobile Accessibility at W3C]](/standards-guidelines/mobile/) _[AG WG, Mobile TF]_

### Defining User Requirements (AUR) and Emerging Technologies

Documenting the user needs of people with disabilities helps develop standards to meet those needs. It also helps designers, developers, and others better understand and meet user needs in order to support accessibility.

* **Natural Language Interface Accessibility User Requirements ("NAUR")** is a Working Draft. A natural language interface is a user interface in which the user and the system communicate via a natural (human) language. The user provides input as sentences via speech or other input, and the system generates responses as sentences delivered by speech, text, or another modality. [About  NAUR](https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/10/natural-language-interface-accessibility-user-requirements-call-for-review/), [NAUR Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/naur)  _[APA WG, Research TF]_

* **XR Accessibility User Requirements (XAUR)** is a Working Draft. XAUR describes the needs of people with disabilities in virtual or immersive environments (XR). It includes requirements for XR to be accessible. XAUR is for designers and developers who are involved in creating XR experiences. [XAUR Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/) _[APA WG, Research TF]_

* **Synchronization Accessibility User Requirements (SAUR)** is a Working Draft. Synchronization of multimedia content, especially audio and video, is essential for accessible web-based communication and cooperation. To be understandable, media needs to be synchronized to very specific limits. [SAUR Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/saur/) _[APA WG, Research TF]_

* **How People with Disabilities Use the Web** helps you understand user needs broadly. We are updating this resrouce and creating videos to go along with it. [[How People with Disabilities Use the Web]](/people-use-web/) _[EOWG]_

* **Cognitive accessibility user requirements** &mdash; Updating documentation on the user needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities is happening through the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA).  _[AG WG, COGA TF]_

### Teaching Accessibility

**Curricula on Web Accessibility** is a framework to build your own courses. It currently includes modules for foundations for everyone, for developers, and for designers. We are currently working on modules for content authors. [[Existing Curricula]](/curricula/), [Content Authors rough draft outline](https://content-author-modules--wai-curricula.netlify.app/curricula/content-author-modules/) _[EOWG]_

### Testing Accessibility

**WCAG 2 Test Rules** (also known as ACT Rules) describe how to test conformance to WCAG success criteria. They are primarily for developers of evaluation tools and test methodologies. [[About WCAG 2 Test Rules]](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/) _[AG WG, ACT TF]_

## Coming Soon to a Publication Near You

The following are just a few of the documents that getting close to publication. To learn about "Candidate Recommendation" (**CR**), "Proposed Recommendation" (**PR**), and other stages, see [How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process: **Milestones** and Opportunities to Contribute](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/).

* **WCAG 2.2** to CR in Q2 2022; finalized in 2022
* **ARIA** @@
* **EPUB 3.3** and EPUB Accessibility 1.1 to CR end of March 2022

* **ARIA 1.2** to PR in Q2 2022;

## Wait, Wait, There's More

This page _only lists about half_ of the active work on accessibility at W3C. Much of the work happens in the accessibility groups that are introduced in the [W3C Working Groups page](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/#wg-list).

To learn more about what that the Working Groups are _up to right now_, see:

* [@@ AG WG Current Work @@](https://www.w3.org/@@) of the Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group

* @@ other W3C group work related to accessibility that we want to list?

### Did you know?

The [W3C WAI website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) has videos, tips, tutorials, translations, a free online course, and so much more. We encourage you to look around to find other resources that you might be interested in reading, contributing to, and sharing with others.

To discover existing accessibility resources that you didn't even know about, see **[[WAI Resources]](/resources/).**

## Here's How to Get Involved {#participate}
